Test Merge
	I don't think there is a way of simulating what will happen until you try the merge. However, if you make sure that the 
	output of git status is empty before you do the merge, it is quite safe to just go ahead and try it. If you get conflicts, 
	you can immediately get back to the state you were at before with:

	git reset --merge

Revert local files to last commit
	git reset --hard  #my experience says to do a "git add ." first.  Otherwise the new files are left on the filesystem.


Automatically stage tracked files -- including deleteing the previously tracked files:
  git add -u :/ (whole working tree)
  git add -u .  (current path)
