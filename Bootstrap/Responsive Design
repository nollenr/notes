<< what about bootstrap themes >>

What my options were and how I decided to go:
Options:
  -Use Direct
   Copy bootstrap.css into assets/stylesheets
   This would be a compiled version of the Less code and is available from git (in root folder)
   
  -less-rails-bootstrap
   adds support for Less into Rails
   Actually includes the Twitter Bootstrat Less Code files (vendor/assets)
   also includes the less-rails gem which integrates Less with Rails
   also includes the less.rb gem which is a wrapper around Less compiler for rails
   also includes therubyracer so that rails can call the V8 Javascript engine
   also includes the libv8 gem to install and compile from source the V8 Javascript library (which is in c)
   
  -twitter-bootstrap-rails
   adds support for Less into Rails, but no test suites unlike less-rails-bootstrap
   
  -sass-twitter-bootstrap
   translated Twitter Bootstrap's Less code into Sass.  Not a gem.  To use, clone the repo
   and copy the bootstrap css file into your app.
   The benefit is that you have sass code and you can use, override or modify.
   Drawback is is that you have to repeat the copy each time Twitter releases a newer, better version.
   
  -bootstrap-sass ***This is the method I'm using*** & -bootstrap-rails
   Similar to sass-twitter-bootstrap except that it is a gem and it takes care of the
   manual copy for you.  
   The "import bootstrap" is at the top... the browser processes from top to bottom, so anything
   that is changed below the import "overrides" what is already in the stylesheet.
   
   The actual css files are in:
   /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p247@rails3214/gems/bootstrap-sass-2.3.2.2/
   
 Text:
   I'm trying to work out the heading sizes on my "hero-unit h1".
   I've tried:
   
   @media (max-width: 480px) {
  .hero-unit h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6  { font-size: 100%; }
   }
   
   but that seems to be taking 100% of the body font size and applying it to the headings.  Not what I want.
   
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9143345/how-to-use-responsive-features-of-bootstrap-2-0
   gave me that suggestion... but I don't think it worked.  I expected it to take some percentage of the
   h1...h6 font size.
