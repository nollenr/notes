Using Bootstrap Modal

_bottle.erb view
  I added a modal div with 3 more divs: header, body and footer
  
  In the modal body is a form.  The form "url" is the routes path to the controller/action.  I also made it "remote: true".
  I also included a simple submit button for the form.
  
bottles controller
  I added a simple action "change_location" action which updates the database
  
change_location.js.erb
  Simple js to update the cellar list page with the new location and then close the modal by causing a "click" on the close button.
