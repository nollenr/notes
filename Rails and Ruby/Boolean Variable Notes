Example:
Added a boolean "buy_at_this_price" using database migration

MODEL
Create instance methods
  Also added buy_at_this_price to the att_accessible section (otherwise the
  database cannot be updated by the controller.

View
Adding a new partial
_bottle_buy_at_this_price.html.erb
  The new partial added a couple of <div>s with a <ul> and <li>s for each item
  Each <li> has an <a> (link_to)

Routes
  Need to add a route for the "buy_again" path and to point to the right place in the 
  controller where the code needs to reside.

Javascript On the Page
start_rating.js.erb
  Added a hover function on the  <a> to make "highlight"the thumb up or thumb down.
  Added a display function to "turn" on an up or down thumb based on what's stored
  in the database.
  
Javascript Called from the Controller (as part of the AJAX) process.
buy_again.js.erb
  update the local stored rating
  set the appropriate gold star

Controller
  Added a new section "buy_again" to respond to the "buy_again_path" added by the
  new route.  This section updates the database and then calls the javascript page
  to refresh the display.

CSS
custom.css.scss

For other AJAX Calls
index.js.erb
  call the hover and display methods:
  $(".thumbRate li a").hover(changeThumb, setThumb);
  $(".rthumbRate").each(function(){displayThumb($(this));});
