Install Apache SSL
	On my server where apache is installed:
	yum install mod_ssl
	
	This created a bunch of stuff I really wasn't prepared for, including a conf.d directory in /etc/httpd/. It
	must have also created a bunch of self-signed certificates.


Create an elastic IP address at AWS
	And associate it with my server instance.  This gave me a 'static IP' as well as another public DNS
	entry for my instance.  At this point, my old DNS entry stopped working... so my Postgres connection 
	from pgadmin3 stopped working, I could no longer ssh using my old DNS entry and the database.yml.
	
	If you check the Network Interface associated with the server, you can see security groups, public and
	private IP addresses, the Private DNS entry and the public DNS entry.
	
	54.200.176.233
	ec2-54-200-176-233.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com


Add port 443 to the Security Group in AWS
	This allows folks from the outside to access that port on my server.


Created a Domain Entry at GoDaddy.com
	create rngwines.com with the public IP address associated with the elastic IP address

Created an SSL certificate at GoDaddy.com
	See the file rngwines.csr.session to see the values I used when createing the certificate request.
	I 'cat'ed the rngwines.csr file and copied and pasted that into the csr request page on GoDaddy.
	After a few minutes, the certificate zip file (27c5e5e418365a.zip) was ready.  I unzipped that
	file in the "/etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crt" directory and got 2 files.  The certificate (27c5e5e418365a.crt)
	and the chain file (gd_bundle.crt).  Both were put into the correct format for me by GoDaddy.

	After setting everything up, I used the SSL Checker (http://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=www.rngwines.com)
	to verify that everything was working correctly.  Love this thing!
	
Changed the hostname
	Not sure I needed to do this... still a little unsure.

Edited the /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf file
	This was the kicker for me.  Apparenly all "mod" conf files go in this directory.
