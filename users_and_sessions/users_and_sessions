users controller
user model

password_digest - user model must contain this column (from has_secure_password)
the hash function bcrypt will irreversibly encrypt the password to form the password hash (need the bcrypt-ruby gem)

password and password _confirmation attributes to the user model and then rquire the two attributes match before the record is saved
password attributes will be virtual.

find a user by using the find_by method
user=User.find_by(email: email)

second step is to use an authenticate method to verify the password
current_user = user.authenticate(password)

has_secure_password:
	password and password_confirmation attributes
	authenticate method to compare encrypted password to the password_digest
	(as long as password_digest column is in the database adding this one method to our model gives us a secure way to create and authenticate new users

I used scaffold to build the user model and views

The before_save on the users model creates a remember_token, encrypts it and stores it to the database.
======================================================

Sessions

model sessions as a RESTful resource.  Sessions resource will use a cookie rather than a database back-end.
Much of the work involved in signin comes from building this cookie-based authentication machinery.

construct:
	session controller and relevant controller actions
	signin form
	cookie manipulation code

REST Actions
	signin form -> new (POST request to the create action)
	signing out is handled by sending a delete

rails g controller Sessions --no-test-framework

the SessionsHelper is already included in all views (by default), and by adding it to the application_controller (include SessionsHelper) it is also
available in all controllers

signing in (the sessions_helper sign_in) get called which creates a new remember_token (unencrypted), puts it in the cookie,
saves it ot the database (encrypted) and then sets the current_user

the current_user getter in sessions_helper will be called once every time a user visits a page on the site.
