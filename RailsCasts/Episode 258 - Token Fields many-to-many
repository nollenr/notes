Bookstore Application:

Assign multiple authors... many to many association

Book Model
Class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
	attr_accessible : name, :author_ids
	has_many :authorships
	has_many :authors, through: : authorships
end

Setting up the form
	Can use checkboxes (see episode 17) but will be a problem if there's a lot of checkboxes
	Can use "chosen", which is a JavaScript plugin available in both jQuery and Prototype.
	
	1st step is to create a multi-select field
	<%= f.collection_select :author_ids, Author.order(:name), :id, :name, {}, {multiple: true}%>
	
	Now use :chosen" - there is a gem to help with that integration called "chosen-rails".  Can use 
	ajax with this as well so that you're not loading too many items.
	
	Another option is to use jQuery Tokeninput... better suited for ajax queries.
	
	Finally, there is a "select2", based on the chosen gem which might be work looking into.
