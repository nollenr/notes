Bootstrap uses Less (css pre-processor), which is _like_ sass.  RB does not recommend downloading Bootstrap (static, compiled) and placing in the app/assets directory.  

gem twitter-bootstrap-rails
only needed in the assets group 
i.e. 
group: assets do 
 ...
 gem 'twitter-bootstrap-rails'
end

several dependancies will be installed with the bundle install (libv8, less-rails)

Then, install bootstrap
rails g bootstrap:install

One thing this installs is app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap_and_overrides.css.less which is where bootstrap can be customized.

At this point we _could_ use "rails g bootstrap:layout [LAYOUT_NAME] [*fixed or fluid]"
Note that the fixed layout is still responsive

if you're using the navbar, you need to make a change to the bootstrap_and_overrides.css.less file...

between the bootstrap and responsive import commands, add "body { paddding-top: 60px; }" so that the top of the page isn't lost behind the navbar.

Also need to add the meta tag to the application.html.erb to ensure that it works everywhere:
<meta name="viewport" content="width-device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

========================================

Twitter Bootstrap
<div class="container"> for a fixed layout of 940px-wide
<div class="container-fluid"> for a fluid layout.

Wrap the "yeild" in the application.html.erb with a container.
