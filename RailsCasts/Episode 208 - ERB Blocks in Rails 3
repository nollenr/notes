Scenario:  Admin area where links are displayed or not given the users status


If you need to fetch the content of a block in the view, just use the with_output_buffer method

<%= admin_area do %>
	link_to "Edit"...
	link_to "Destroy" ...
	link_to "View All"...
<% end %>

Inside the ApplicationHelper
module Application Helper
	def admin_area(&block)   <- meaning that it has a little block that it accepts
		"whatever"           <- this will just return "whatever"  ...no links will be shown on the page
	end
end


Inside the ApplicationHelper
module Application Helper
	def admin_area(&block)   <- meaning that it has a little block that it accepts
		content = capture(&block)
		content_tag(:div, content, :class=>"admin)           
	end
end

Inside the ApplicationHelper
module Application Helper
	def admin_area(&block)   <- meaning that it has a little block that it accepts
		content_tag(:div, :class=>"admin, &block)   
	end
