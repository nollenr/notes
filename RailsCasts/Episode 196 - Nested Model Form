Model
class Survey...
  attr_accessible :name, :questions_attributes #so that the question attributes can be set
  has_name :questions
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :questions
  # accepts_nested_attributes_for :questions, allow_destroy: true # destroy is disabled by default
end

View template
<%= form_for @survey do |f| %>
  ...
  <div class="field">
  	<%= f.label :name %>
  	<%= f.text_field :name %>
  </div>
  
  #add this to the form
  <%= f.fields_for :questions do |builder| %>  # passing in a form builder for each question
  	<fieldset>
  	  <%= builder.label :content, "Question" %> # a call to builder to make a label
  	  <%= builder.text_area :content %>  # a call to builder to make a text_area for editing the questions content attribute
  	  <%= builder.check_box :_destroy %> # to allow us to remove a question from the form.  Need to change the model to allow destroy
  	  <%= builder.label :destroy, "Remove Question" %>
  	</fieldset>
