Flash Messages using Twitter Bootstrap
Alerts (already working)
Need to wrap the message in "alter-error" or "alert-success"

Closing Alerts
simply add a close html
<a class="close" data-dismiss="alert">x</a>

bootstrap-sass
===================================
https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/3/docs/RAILS.md
https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/3/tasks/converter.rb

It seems like this gem has converted bootstrap (maybe v3?) and left it as 
part of the gem (see /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p247@rails3214/gems/bootstrap-sass-2.3.2.2/vendor/assets/stylesheets)

How do I know what version of bootstrap it is using?

It looks like the converter may update just the bootstrap piece, but it places it in /vendor/assets.
