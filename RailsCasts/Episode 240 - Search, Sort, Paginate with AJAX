See Railscasts #37 for search form

Creating persistance with sort and search:
	Need hidden fields in the view
	<%= hidden_field_tag :direction, params[:direction] %>
	<%= hidden_field_tag :sort, params[:sort] %>

Need a sortable helper (call sortable see episode #228) which contains the "link_to"
	However, we always want the page to start at 1 after a sort, so we need to add "page: nil" to the params.merge statement!
	(Is this going to be a problem for displaying the "previous 1 2 3... next, last" buttons?)
	
AJAX
====================================
Remember that "back" and "bookmarks" won't work correctly with AJAX... Will AJAX improve the user experience?
